### Clarius Calibration Tutorial: Part 2
#### Prerequisites:
Please note many of these supplies/tools can be found by asking Adam Rankin. Also, you might be able to reuse our prototype at Robarts.
- Part 1 completed (ClariusTracker/calibrationClarius/Aruco_PDFs).
- A 3D Printer and filament.
  - We used an Ultimaker Cura 5.0.0.
- A CT Scanner.
- A plastic container to hold water.
- One 6mm diameter spherical bead.
- 6mm hole bore machine (Ask Adam Rankin).
- Fishing wire.
- A file.
- A glue stick.
- A hot glue gun and sticks.

#### Steps:
1. To start, 3D print a copy of all STL files inside the folder "final_designs", except "opticalPeg.STL". You'll need to 3D print 3 copies of "opticalPeg.STL". Note that these parts are mostly hollow, and that their buoyancy can make it difficult to keep them glued onto other objects while submerged. To mitigate this, you can either make your prints more dense by increasing the Infill (%), or apply larger amounts of glue.
2. Once the parts have been completed, remove all supports used to produce the parts, and file any straight edges to avoid being injured.
3. Now, find the three Aruco markers you printed in Part 1, and find the 3D printed parts "StylusV2", "arucoStand", and "clariusArucoV3".
4. Next, use the glue stick to glue Marker 0 onto the fronts of "StylusV2", Marker 1 onto "arucoStand", and Marker 2 onto "clariusArucoV3". Again, try not to use an excessive amount of glue for this task. Allow these markers to dry.
5. Hot glue "clariusArucoV3" onto "clariusMoldV2". Ensure the Marker platform is facing away from the bottom of the mold.
